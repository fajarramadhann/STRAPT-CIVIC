## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. **Sender** creates a transaction:
   - via username / address / QR / link
   - optional: password or message
2. **Receiver** gets the link:
   - signs in via Gmail (walletless)
   - claim funds in 1-click
3. If unclaimed, **Sender** can refund anytime after expiry.

> STRAPT = Web2 simplicity × Web3 security × IRL use cases.
